            <span class="first-letter">木</span>工得要每幾年就要學新的、更好的鋸木板方法嗎？畫家會因為還在用油畫，而覺得心虛嗎？還是說，就只有我們前端開發者才可以體會這樣經常變化的情況？

            快要推出的不只 Container Queries，肯定的是變動得非常快。既然得要跟上腳步，我們花了點時間，讓調查結果本身裝上威力加強版！

            實做上的意思是，現在可以交叉參考兩個資料點。例如：以經驗來區分年收入、以國家來區分性別。在整篇調查結果裡，會看到一些細節，但我們鼓勵在 [API](https://api.stateofjs.com/) 或[下載資料](https://www.kaggle.com/sachag/state-of-css)後深入探索資料。如果最後以此做出你的資料視覺化作品，跟我們說一聲吧！

            現在，就來看看今年 CSS 過得怎麼樣！

            *附註：由於時間不夠，2021 [JavaScript 現況調查](http://stateofjs.com/)已經推遲至 2022 一月舉行。假期之後見！

            <span class="first-line">The way you write CSS is about to change forever</span>

            For many years now, many innovations in writing styles for the web have happened elsewhere: in preprocessors, JavaScript frameworks, or compilers. To be sure, CSS itself has also received some welcome improvements like [aspect-ratio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio) or [custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*). Yet we still reach for libraries and other helpers on a daily basis.

            But there's a change coming. The core CSS language is getting shaken up and renewed, and we're right at the forefront of accelerated evolution.

            [Container Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries) will bring in an entirely new era of responsive design, and [Cascade Layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) will make our use of frameworks, theming and managing complex codebases significantly easier.

            When we look a little further ahead, we can also see the [@when/else conditional](https://css-tricks.com/proposal-for-css-when/) coming up, which will let us combine media, container and supports queries into a single at-rule.

            And fingers crossed, 2022 is the year we finally see some movement on native CSS nesting. Those of us that work with tools like Sass and PostCSS already couldn't imagine another way of working.

            All of this together means that 2022 is likely to be a year where the way you write CSS is going to fundamentally change. It's an incredibly exciting period, and we look forward to all the amazing implementations in the year to come.

# FAQ/About

    - key: about.content
      t: >
            The 2021 State of CSS survey ran from October 5 to November 2 2021, and collected 8714 responses. The survey is run by me, [Sacha Greif](https://sachagreif.com/), with help from a team of open-source contributors and consultants.


            This year's logo and t-shirt were designed and animated by [Christopher Kirk-Nielsen](http://chriskirknielsen.com/).

            ### Survey Goals

            This survey, along with the [State of JavaScript](https://stateofjs.com/) survey, was created to identify upcoming trends in the web development ecosystem in order to help developers make technological choices.


            As such, these surveys are focused on anticipating what's coming over the next few years rather than analyzing what's popular now, which is why the features or technologies that are currently most widespread are not always included.

            ### Survey Design

            The survey was designed in part based on last year's survey, with an open feedback period where the survey outline was discussed [on GitHub](https://github.com/StateOfJS/StateOfCSS-2020/issues/8).

            All survey questions were optional.

            ### Survey Audience

            The survey was openly accessible online and respondents were not filtered or selected in any way. Respondents were primarily a mix of respondents from past surveys (alerted through a dedicated mailing list) and social media traffic.

            ### Representativeness & Inclusivity

            While we believe it's important to give a voice to every community, the reality is that an open survey like this one will always struggle to properly represent everybody, especially when operating through systems that already carry their own inherent biases.


            In order to counter-balance this, we are implementing three distinct strategies:


            - **Outreach**: this year, we reached out to 23 organizations representing BIPOC and LGBTQ developers in the hopes of partnering up. While very few of them replied, we will keep looking for ways to reach out beyond our current audience.

            - **Data Analysis**: through features like facets and variants, we're always trying to make it easier to surface the voices of any demographic segment, no matter how minoritized it might be in our data.

            - **Barrier Lowering**: making the survey too long, inaccessible, slow to load, English-only, etc. can all contribute to imposing an "effort tax" that cuts off the parts of the community that can't afford to pay it. Fixing these issues can lower the barrier to entry and in the process make our audience more diverse.

            ### Project Funding

            Funding from this project comes from a variety of sources:


            - **T-shirt sales**.

            - **Sponsored links**: the links to recommended resources at the bottom of each page are provided by our partner [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/).

            - **Other Funding**: this year, the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) team set aside a small budget to help hire an [accessibility consultant](https://fossheim.io/) to work on the survey.


            Despite these funding sources, the surveys remains mostly a self-funded project overall and any contribution or sponsorship would be greatly appreciated. I would especially like to work closely with more browser vendors, since they play such a central role in the web ecosystem.

            ### Technical Overview

            You can find a more in-depth technical overview of how the surveys are run [here](https://dev.to/sachagreif/how-the-state-of-js-css-surveys-are-run-4lnb).

            - **Data collection**: custom [Vulcan.js](http://vulcanjs.org/) app.

            - **Data storage/processing**: MongoDB & MongoDB Aggregations.

            - **Data API**: Node.js GraphQL API.

            - **Results Site**: [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) React app.

            - **Data Visualizations**: [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks/) React dataviz library.

            - **Type**: [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono) and [Bebas Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue).
